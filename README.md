## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing coffee shop sales data using Python (Jupyter Lab) and Power BI to uncover meaningful business insights. The analysis includes key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, product performance, and customer ordering patterns.<br>

Using Python, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and explored through visualizations to identify daily, monthly, and hourly sales trends. Power BI was then used to build an interactive dashboard showcasing total revenue, total orders, quantity sold, best-selling and least-selling products, and category-wise sales distribution.<br>

The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow — from raw data preprocessing to insight-driven visualization — helping stakeholders make data-backed decisions for sales optimization and business growth.<br>
